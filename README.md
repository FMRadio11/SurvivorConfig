# SurvivorConfig
(Ignore the LabRebalance thing, this was originally meant to use values taken from the lab Discord before I realized those were meant for a mod someone else was working on)

Currently lets you modify HP, Shield, Regen, Damage, Armor, and base Speed of all survivors (and Heretic).

More details are included in the Thunderstore page, found here: https://thunderstore.io/package/FMRadio11/SurvivorConfig/1.0.0/
